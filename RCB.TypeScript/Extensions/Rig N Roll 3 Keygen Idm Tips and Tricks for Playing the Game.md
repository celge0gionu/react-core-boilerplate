- Game Chronicles: \"Having had no other experience with big rig trucking simulators, I can't say how Rig'n'Roll compares to its competitors, but it seems to run fairly smoothly and accomplish what it sets out to do as a truck-driving and trucking business simulator.\" [^2^]
- Amazon customer: \"I have not yet been able to determine if there is random CB chatter available in Rig-n-Roll as there is in 18WoS; a needless but fun feature. The vehicular damage and weather modelling are both very nice in Rig-n-Roll, and the physics and traffic models are both superb and adjustable.\" [^3^]
